Wingbird drops a malicious file (sspisrv.dll) alongside a copy of lsass.exe, which is used to register a service that loads sspisrv.dll as a driver. The payload of the malicious driver (located in its entry-point function) is executed when loaded by lsass.exe before the spoofed service becomes unstable and crashes.
Pasam establishes  by infecting the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) DLL to load a malicious DLL dropped to disk.
